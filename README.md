This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP related to type hinting.  Type hinting, while helpful for code clarity and maintainability, can be circumvented if the function doesn't explicitly check the types of input parameters. The example shows how a function with type hinting can still accept incorrect data types, leading to unexpected behavior or errors. The solution demonstrates a way to improve type checking to mitigate this issue.
